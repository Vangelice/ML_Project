# ML_Project

## Introduction
This is a project about using machine learning to characterize the quantum circuit noise. We try to focus on a special family of noise -- Pauli noise in quantum computing, which vastly simplifies the problem. We show that this machine learning-based method can help to remove some tedious and sophisticated designed post-processing.

## Contents
This repository contains all the implementation codes. The "result.hdf5" records all data generated from "main.py". We employ "plot.ipynb" to plot some figures in "result_a.pdf" used in our report.
